Language sometimes becomes a weapon to humiliate other languages. In this regard, we can witness the dominance / hegemony / power that English language has over other languages. English has become a language of dominance in India and most importantly, in academics.  Meganathan (2011) in his paper shows the number of languages taught as first, second and third languages in Indian schools across states. The data shows that the second language being available/offered majorly/commonly is English as compared to Hindi, Sanskrit or MIL.

As is evident from the three language formula that the language to be taught as first language should be the mother tongue or regional language of the child. But it’s the implementation of three language formula in private schools in Northern India (saying so because I have no experience/knowledge about the other regions’ schools) seems to be altered. The way schools adopt it changes the very definition of first, second and third language.  The altered form comes out to be that the first language is defined as the language studied during the whole duration of schooling, i.e. till senior secondary.

Rege (2010) writes about the Dalit imaginations of symbolic and material power of language. She draws our attention to the knowledge and standardisation being denied to languages related to the lower caste people or non-brahmins. Language as marker of subordination and exclusion in academics. Taking instances from writings of Kumud Pawde, Kancha Illiah, Chandra Bhan Prasad, and Pragnya Daya Panwar, she depicts how caste hindered, became obstacles and discriminated them from achieving education and the language-question emerging from power structures. She writes about medium of instruction and labels of English medeium, hindi medium and Marathi medium  being given to students, fear of identities of caste, gender and their effect on the content.
